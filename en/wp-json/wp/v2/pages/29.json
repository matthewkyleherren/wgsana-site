(henceforth the Website) uses Cookies. Cookies are files sent to a browser through a web server to record the activities of the User on a specific website. The primary purpose of Cookies is to provide the user with quicker access to the services selected. Also, Cookies personalise the services that the Website offers, facilitating and offering each user information that is of interest to them or that may be of interest to them, in accordance with how they use the Services.<\/p>\n<p>The Website uses Cookies to personalise and fully facilitate the browsing of the user. Cookies are only associated with an anonymous user and their computer and do not provide references that may make it possible to infer the user\u00b4s personal data. The user can configure their browser so that it notifies them and rejects the installation of Cookies sent by the Website, without this harming the possibility of the user to access the content of the website. However, please note that, in any case, the operating quality of the Website may decrease.<\/p>\n<p>Registered users, those who register or who have logged in, can benefit from more personalised services that are targeted at their profile, thanks to the combination of the data stored in the cookies and the personal data used at the time of their registration. These users expressly authorise the use of this information for the purpose indicated, without prejudice to their right to reject or disable the use of cookies.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, the Website may find out all the services requested by users, so it can facilitate or offer the right information to suit the tastes and preferences of each user.<\/p>\n<h2>What type of cookies are there?<\/h2>\n<p>Cookies, depending on their Permanence, can be divided into:<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Session cookies<\/td>\n<td>They expire when the user closes the browser.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Persistent cookies<\/td>\n<td>They expire according to when the objective that they serve has been fulfilled (for example, in order for the user to remain identified in the Services) or when they are manually deleted.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>Depending on their Owner, they can be divided into:<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Own cookies<\/td>\n<td>They are those that are sent to the terminal equipment of the user from a computer or domain that is managed by the editor and from which the service requested by the user is provided.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Third party cookies<\/td>\n<td>They are those that are sent to the terminal equipment of the user from a computer or domain that is not managed by the editor, but rather by another entity that processes the data obtained through the cookies.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>Additionally, depending on their Objective, Cookies can be classified in the following way:<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Performance cookies<\/td>\n<td>These types of Cookies remember your preferences for the tools that are found in the services, therefore you do not need to configure the service again each time that you visit. For example, this type include&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The volume settings on video or sound players.<\/li>\n<li>Video streaming speeds that are compatible with your browser.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Geolocation Cookies<\/td>\n<td>These Cookies are used to find out which country you are in when a service is requested. This Cookie is completely anonymous, and is only used to help to guide the content for your location.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Registration cookies<\/td>\n<td>Registration cookies are created once the user has registered or has subsequently opened their session, and they are used to identify them in the services with the following objectives:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep the user identified so that, if a service, the browser or computer is closed and you enter the service again at another time or on another day, you will remain identified, thus facilitating your browsing without having to identify yourself again. This feature can be deleted if the user clicks on the \u201clog out\u201d feature, so that this Cookie is deleted and the next time that the user enters the service they will have to log in, in order to be identified.<\/li>\n<li>Check if the user is authorised to access certain services, for example, in order to participate in a competition.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Analytics cookies<\/td>\n<td>Each time that a User visits a service, a tool from an external provider generates an analytic cookie on the user\u00b4s computer. This Cookie, which is only created during the visit, will be used in future visits by the Web Service to anonymously identify the visitor. The main objectives pursued:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable the anonymous identification of browsers through the \u201cCookies\u201d (it identifies browsers and devices, not people) and therefore an approximate count of the number of visitors and their trend over time.<\/li>\n<li>Anonymously identify the most visited content and thus the most appealing for users.<\/li>\n<li>Find out if the user who is accessing is new or a return visitor.<\/li>\n<li>Important: Unless the user decides to register on a service on the Website, the \u201cCookie\u201d will never be associated with any personal data that could be used to identify them. These Cookies will only be used for statistical purposes that help to optimise the experience of Users on the site.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Behavioural advertising cookies<\/td>\n<td>This type of \u201cCookies\u201d makes it possible to gain broader information from advertisements shown to each anonymous user in the Web Services. Among others, it stores the duration or frequency of the display of advertising positions, the interaction with them, and the browsing and\/or behavioural patterns of the user as they help to create a profile of advertising interest. Thus, they make it possible to offer advertising that suits the interests of the user.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Third party advertising cookies<\/td>\n<td>In addition to the advertising managed by the Website in its Services, the Website offers its advertisers the option to serve advertisements through third parties (\u201cAdServers\u201d). Thus, these third parties can store Cookies sent through the Web Services from the browsers of Users, and also access the data stored on them.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h2>What cookies do we use?<\/h2>\n<p>The cookies that we use on our website are:<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\">OWN<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<th>NAME<\/th>\n<th>TYPE<\/th>\n<th>DOMAIN<\/th>\n<th>EXPIRY<\/th>\n<th>PURPOSE<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wp-settings-time-68<\/td>\n<td>Necessary<\/td>\n<td>www.caledonian.es<\/td>\n<td>1 year<\/td>\n<td>Functioning of the site<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>viewed_cookie_policy<\/td>\n<td>Necessary<\/td>\n<td>www.caledonian.es<\/td>\n<td>1 year<\/td>\n<td>Functioning of the site<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>cookielawinfo-checkbox-necessary<\/td>\n<td>Necessary<\/td>\n<td>www.caledonian.es<\/td>\n<td>1 year<\/td>\n<td>Functioning of the site<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CookieLawInfoConsent<\/td>\n<td>Necessary<\/td>\n<td>www.caledonian.es<\/td>\n<td>1 year<\/td>\n<td>Functioning of the site<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>cookielawinfo-checkbox-analytics<\/td>\n<td>Necessary<\/td>\n<td>www.caledonian.es<\/td>\n<td>1 year<\/td>\n<td>Functioning of the site<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\">FROM THIRD PARTIES<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<th>NAME<\/th>\n<th>TYPE<\/th>\n<th>DOMAIN<\/th>\n<th>EXPIRY<\/th>\n<th>PURPOSE<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>_gid<\/td>\n<td>Analysis<\/td>\n<td>www.google.com<\/td>\n<td>3 months<\/td>\n<td>Analysis<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>_ga<\/td>\n<td>Analysis<\/td>\n<td>www.google.com<\/td>\n<td>1 day<\/td>\n<td>Analysis<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>_gat<\/td>\n<td>Analysis<\/td>\n<td>www.google.com<\/td>\n<td>1 day<\/td>\n<td>Analysis<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>_gat_gtag_UA_75368138_1<\/td>\n<td>Analysis<\/td>\n<td>www.google.com<\/td>\n<td>1 day<\/td>\n<td>Analysis<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h2>Are there international transfers?<\/h2>\n<p>You can get information about transfers to third countries which, where appropriate, are carried out by the third parties identified in this cookies policy in their corresponding policies (see the links provided in the \u201cThird party cookies\u201d section).
